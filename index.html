                    <p>
                         Tired of endless scrolling, infinite feeds, and phones that know more about you than your best friend?
                         Yeah, same. At Zero Scroll, we celebrate the golden age of mobile phones — when batteries lasted for days, screens were small on purpose,
                         and the hardest decision you had to make was which polyphonic ringtone to show off.
                         We sell iconic retro phones, from legendary bricks and flipping masterpieces to Snake-approved classics and chargers that somehow still work.
                         No algorithms, no doomscrolling, no accidental three-hour TikTok spirals — just buttons, beeps, and beautiful simplicity.
                        Plug out of the noise and power up the past.
