                    Welcome to <span class="highlight">Zero Scroll</span> - where your thumb finally get's a
                    vacation.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of endless scrolling, infinite feeds, and phones that
                    know more about you than your best friend? Yeah, same. At
                    Zero Scroll, we celebrate the golden age of mobile phones —
                    when batteries lasted for days, screens were small on
                    purpose, and the hardest decision you had to make was which
                    polyphonic ringtone to show off. We sell iconic retro
                    phones, from legendary bricks and flipping masterpieces to
                    Snake-approved classics and chargers that somehow still
                    work. No algorithms, no doomscrolling, no accidental
                    three-hour TikTok spirals — just buttons, beeps, and
                    beautiful simplicity. Plug out of the noise and power up the
                    past.
